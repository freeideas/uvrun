# req-fix_accuracy.md -- Check Requirements Accuracy

Check if requirements in `./reqs/` accurately reflect the README documentation.

**README has already been validated for quality. This prompt checks if requirements correctly represent what README says.**

---

## THE SEVEN RULES FOR REQUIREMENTS

1. **Complete Coverage** -- Every reasonably testable behavior in READMEs must have a $REQ_ID
2. **No Invention** -- Only requirements from READMEs are allowed
3. **No Overspecification** -- Requirements must not be more specific than READMEs
4. **Tell Stories** -- Flows go from start to shutdown (complete use-case scenarios)
5. **Source Attribution** -- Every $REQ_ID cites: `**Source:** ./readme/FILE.md (Section: "Name")`
6. **Unique IDs** -- Each $REQ_ID appears exactly once. Format: `$REQ_` followed by letters/digits/underscores/hyphens (e.g., $REQ_STARTUP_001)
7. **Reasonably Testable** -- Requirements must have observable behavior that can be verified

## What Is Inaccurate?

A requirement is inaccurate when it misrepresents what the README says.

**Common inaccuracies:**

### 1. Inverting Behavior

**README:** "Port defaults to 43143 if not provided"
**Inaccurate req:** "Must display error and exit if port not provided"
**Problem:** Opposite of what README says

### 2. Misinterpreting Examples as Requirements

**README:** "For example, if buffer fills memory, the process will crash with OOM instead of blocking connections"
**Inaccurate req:** "Must crash with OOM when buffer fills"
**Problem:** Example was illustrating non-blocking behavior, not requiring OOM crash

### 3. Adding Error Handling Not in README

**README:** "Accepts one directory argument"
**Inaccurate req:** "Must exit with error code 1 if multiple directories provided"
**Problem:** Added error handling not stated in README -- focus on happy path unless README explicitly documents error behavior

### 4. Requirements That Contradict Each Other

When two requirements can't both be true, at least one misrepresents the README:

**Req A:** "Must start immediately when launched"
**Req B:** "Must wait for user confirmation before starting"
**Problem:** Both can't be true -- check README to see which is correct

Contradictions between requirements are evidence of misinterpretation.

## Your Task

1. Read `./README.md` and all files in `./readme/`
2. Read all flow files in `./reqs/`
3. For each requirement, verify it accurately reflects the cited README source
4. Look for contradictions between requirements as symptoms of inaccuracy
5. Fix requirements to match README documentation
6. **Focus on significant inaccuracies** -- ignore minor wording differences; only fix clear misrepresentations

## Output Format

**Do NOT create any report files.** Just respond with a simple list.

**If significant issues found:** For each change, list:
- File: (which file was edited)
- Before: (the inaccurate requirement text, including $REQ_ID)
- After: (the corrected requirement text)
- Why: (how it misrepresented README)

**If no significant issues found:** State that requirements accurately reflect README documentation.
